 * I/O ports access.
 *
 * The x86 architecture is special in that, in addition to the physical memory
 * address space, it also has an I/O port space. Most modern processors use
 * the physical memory address space to access memory-mapped device memory and
 * registers, and that's also the case on x86, but the I/O port space is also
 * used for this purpose, at least for some legacy devices.
