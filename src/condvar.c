 * Structure used to bind a waiting thread and a condition variable.

 * The purpose of this structure is to avoid adding the node to the thread
 * structure. Instead, it's allocated from the stack and only exists while
 * the thread is waiting for the condition variable to be signalled.
 *
 * When another thread signals the condition variable, it finds threads
 * to wake up by accessing the condition variable list of waiters.
 *
 * The awaken member records whether the waiting thread has actually been
 * awaken, to guard against spurious wake-ups.
 *
 * Preemption must be disabled when accessing a waiter.

     * when waiting on it. This means that, when broadcasting a condition
     * variable on which many threads are waiting, they will all be awaken,
     * but only one of them acquires the associated mutex. All the others

     * round of wake-ups closely followed by sleeps may be very expensive
     * compared to the cost of the critical sections around the wait, and
     * that cost increases linearly with the number of waiting threads.
     *
     * Smarter but more complicated implementations can avoid this problem,
     * e.g. by directly queuing the current waiters on the associated mutex.
